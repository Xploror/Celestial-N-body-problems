# Celestial-dynamics-problems

This repository contains astrodynamics problems mostly comprising of Circular Restricted Three Body Problem and Resonance Orbits for various Solar System subspace systems and interstellar systems. The initial work comprises of Cislunar space and Jovian system with all 3 Galilean moons. 

### Examples:

#### Example1: Cislunar Natural Transfer
This example depicts a basic lunar natural transfer of a spacecraft with an initial eccentric orbit. The plots show both the inertial and rotating frame of the entire transfer!

#### Example2: Jovian Delta-V Transfer
Another example represents a transfer maneuver around the Jupiter and its 3 moons. The spacecraft starts at an arbitrary orbit around Jupiter and after 1 complete revolution, it implements a Delta-V maneuver to have a final orbit that is 2:1 resonance with Ganymede. Moreover, the plots also show the potential field contour plots as well as the acceleration vector field that shows the variations of the magnitude of potential fields and the alignments and mis-alignments of acceleration vector as the moons aligns and mis-aligns periodically! Here Ganymede (most massive moon out of all) has the most influence to an extend that the spacecraft in 2:1 resonance orbit could get massive delta-V boost if all the moons align, due to the proximity to Ganymede. `[Note: the scaling of Jupiter's gravity is manipulated in the contour plots to show the relative contributions of other moons. In reality the Jupiter's gravity is 30000 times more massive!]`
