# Celestial-dynamics-problems

This repository contains astrodynamics problems mostly comprising of Circular Restricted Three Body Problem and Resonance Orbits for various Solar System subspace systems and interstellar systems. The initial work comprises of Cislunar space and Jovian system with all 4 Galilean moons. 

### Examples:

#### Example1: Cislunar Natural Transfer
This example depicts a basic lunar natural transfer of a spacecraft with an initial eccentric orbit. The plots show both the inertial and rotating frame of the entire transfer!
